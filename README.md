## üìã Table Structure

The table used in this project is named `MARKSHEET` and includes the following columns:

| Column     | Type         | Description                       |

| ID         | INT          | Student ID (e.g., 1803001)        |
| NAME       | VARCHAR(50)  | Student's full name (in uppercase)|
| ADDRESS    | VARCHAR(50)  | One of: DHAKA, KHULNA, BARISHAL, RAJSHAHI |
| GENDER     | VARCHAR(10)  | MALE or FEMALE                    |
| MATH       | INT          | Marks in Mathematics              |
| PHYSICS    | INT          | Marks in Physics                  |
| CHEMISTRY  | INT          | Marks in Chemistry                |

## üß† Practice Questions

1. **Show all student names and their math marks sorted by highest math score.**

2. **Find all students who are from _DHAKA_ and scored more than _80_ in _BIOLOGY_.**

3. **Show the total marks (sum of math, physics, chemistry, biology) for each student.**

4. **Find the student with the highest total marks.**

5. **Count how many students are from each address (DHAKA, KHULNA, BARISHAL, RAJSHAHI).**

6. **Find the average marks in physics for FEMALE students.**

7. **List all students whose total marks are below 250.**

8. **Display all students sorted by address and then by name alphabetically.**

9. **How many MALE and FEMALE students are there?**

10. **Show students who have scored at least 90 in all four subjects (MATH, PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY).**
